## UX
To understand what kind of website we need to deliver for the client, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analysing and breaking down the problem into five planes:

### 1. Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the business objective and the user needs (goals).

| Business Goal | Customer Goals |
| :------------- | :---------- |
|  As an owner of the restaurant I want the website to: | As a customer I want to:  |       
| 1. Be eye-catching and attract customers by using a simple and unique design  | 1. Contact the restaurant for a reservation or more information | 
| 2. Have the ability to contact the owner or make a reservation through a form | 2. To be more familiar with the chef’s cooking and history of this restaurant 
| 3. Increase marketing by having social media links on the website | 3. See photos of the dishes | 
| 4. Send newsletters for latest update | 4. See the price of the menu and download a PDF version of the menu  | 
| 5. To have the ability to accept a payment for a reservation  | 5. Make a reservation through an agenda | 


### 2. Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include in the website.

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|
| :------------- | :---------- |
1.	Navigation menu bar: Home, About, Gallery, Contact | 1. Subscribe to newsletter for latest updates
2.	Hero images (carousel) | 2. Make a reservation through an agenda
3.	Restaurant information including a downloadable PDF menu| 3. Accept payment for a reservation through the website
4.	Location of the restaurant through Google maps | 
5.	Footer with copyright and social media links|  
6.	Photo gallery (page includes same footer, contact form and map from landing page) | 
7.	About page (page includes same footer, contact form and map from landing page) | 


### 3. Structure Plane
The structure plane defines the information architecture and interaction design with the user. The following definitions will be used for this website:
- First impression of the website needs to be simple and clear as possible
- No more than three clicks are required for the user to reach a page
- Using content hinting to encourage the customer to scroll down 
- The type of information architecture that will be used is the ‘Hierarchical Tree’, see image below
