# Saitama Dainingu | A Private Dining Experience
Code Institute Milestone Project 1 - Static Front End Website

This project is a website with three pages. The purpose of this website is to attract and inform new customers by a simple, but strong, visual design. The website contains functional information, such as a contact form and a downloadable menu, as well as an image gallery and a background story to balance the purpose of the website.

## UX
To understand what kind of website we need to deliver to the client, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analysing and breaking down the problem into five planes:

### 1. Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the business objective and the user needs (goals). The goals for this project are defined as:

| Business Goal | Customer Goals |
| :------------- | :---------- |
|  As an owner of the restaurant I want the website to: | As a customer I want to:  |       
| 1. Be eye-catching and attract customers by using a simple and unique design  | 1. Contact the restaurant for a reservation or more information | 
| 2. Have the ability to contact the owner or make a reservation through a form | 2. To be more familiar with the chef’s cooking and history of this restaurant 
| 3. Increase marketing by having social media links on the website | 3. See photos of chef's dishes | 
| 4. Send newsletters for latest update | 4. See the price of the menu and download a PDF version of the menu  | 
| 5. To have the ability to accept a payment for a reservation  | 5. Make a reservation through an agenda | 


### 2. Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include in the website. This will be further in detail explained in the next chapter. A summary of the included and not included features are:

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|
| :------------- | :---------- |
|1. Navigation menu bar: Home, About, Gallery, Contact | 1. Subscribe to newsletter for latest updates
|2. Hero images | 2. Make a reservation through an agenda
|3. Reseservation information and a downloadable PDF menu| 3. Accept payment for a reservation through the website
|4. Location of the restaurant through Google maps | 
|5. Footer with copyright and social media links|  
|6. Photo gallery | 
|7. About page | 


### 3. Structure Plane
The structure plane defines the information architecture and interaction design with the user. The following definitions has been used for this website:
- First impression of the website needs to be simple and clear as possible
- No more than three clicks are required for the user to reach a page
- The type of information architecture that will be used is the ‘Hierarchical Tree’, see image below

### 4. Skeleton Plane
The skeleton plane defines a basic visual design of the website through, for example a wireframe. The wireframes for this project can be downloaded from the link:

- [Wireframe - Desktop version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/milestone-project-1/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Desktop%20Version.pdf)
- [Wireframe - Tablet version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/milestone-project-1/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Tablet%20Version.pdf)
- [Wireframe - Mobile version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/milestone-project-1/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Mobile%20Version.pdf)

### 5. Surface Plane
The surface plane is the final plane in the design process and defines the appearance of the website. This website needs to attract customers, but also needs to reflect the calmness during the dining experience. The following design style has been used:

| Design Style | Design Choice|
| :------------- | :---------- |
Font: Noto Serif JP | A Japanese Google font that reflects the theme of the business
Text color: #fde3a7 | A bright yellow color that represents wealth and success in Japan 
Background color: 2A2A2A | A calm background that represent the dining experience
Contrast ratio: 11.42 | A high ratio to express the visibility of the text (source: contrast-ratio.com)
